## Problem Statement

You are given **n** apples with known weights. The task is to divide these apples into two groups such that the difference between the weights of the groups is minimal.

### Input
- The first input line contains an integer **n**: the number of apples.
- The second line contains **n** integers **p_1, p_2, ..., p_n**: the weight of each apple.

### Output
- Print one integer: the minimum difference between the weights of the two groups.

### Constraints
- \(1 \le n \le 20\)
- \(1 \le p_i \le 10^9\)
